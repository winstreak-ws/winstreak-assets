## About Qlient

**Qlient.net** was a collective of passionate programmers deeply involved in the gaming sector, particularly within the realms of Minecraft and Discord communities. The team's core mission centered around empowering players and enhancing their gaming experiences. Their flagship project, **Soov**, is a sophisticated Discord bot designed to assist Minecraft players by providing seamless access to Hypixel statistics, enabling users to analyze progress, refine strategies, and overcome challenges in Minecraft survival. Qlient aimed to foster a community where players could grow, learn, and celebrate achievements together. The legacy of Qlient continues through Winstreak.ws, building upon the foundations established by the original team.
